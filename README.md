# DeepFakeCounter
Deep Fake Counter or "DFC" aims to bring a classification method to determining if an image was generated by AI or not.

## Dataset
- [CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images)

## How to Run
Create the conda environment
```
conda create -y -n deepfakecounter python=3.10
```

Activate the environment
```
conda activate deepfakecounter
```

Pip install the requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change directory into the src folder then run main.py
```
cd src/
```

Go into the config.py file. I'm assuming you're on a gpu. If not, change ACCELERATOR to 'cpu' then run the following

```
python main.py
```

### Result Analysis

## Future Works
- Expand work to classifying fake human photos. Currently the model fails to correctly classify fake human pictures.
